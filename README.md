Penguin Subtitle Player is an open-source, cross-platform standalone subtitle player, as an alternative to [Greenfish Subtitle Player](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Other-VIDEO-Tools/Greenfish-Subtitle-Player.shtml), [SrtViewer (Mac)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/srtviewer/), [SRTPlayer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleplayer/), [JustSubsPlayer](https://justsubsplayer.codeplex.com/) and [Free Subtitle Player](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesubtitleplayer/).

You download the subtitle file (`.srt`, `.ssa`, `.ass`, `.vtt`) from any sites you like and load it into the subtitle player. The subtitle player provides a translucent window which always stays on the top so that subtitles can be shown on top of the video without blocking anything.

With Penguin Subtitle Player, just open your favorite online streaming site, load the subtitle file into the player, and enjoy.

## Building

#### 1. Clone the project & download dependencies

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carsonip/Penguin-Subtitle-Player
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/carsonip/Penguin-Subtitle-Player
cd Penguin-Subtitle-Player
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 2. Build

Use one of the following ways:

##### a. The easy way (GUI)

1. Download Qt with Qt Creator [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
2. Open the .pro file in Qt Creator
3. You should be good to go (In case of some weird compilation errors, turn off the shadow build option in projects build settings)

##### b. The hard way (Command line)

1. Download Qt (Qt Creator is not required) [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
2. Run qmake
  ```
  qmake PenguinSubtitlePlayer.pro
  ```
3. Build from the makefile generated by qmake
  * G++ (Linux, macOS): ```make```
  * VC++ (Windows): ```nmake```
  * MinGW (Windows): ```mingw32-make```
4. You should see the executable under ```build/debug``` or ```build/release```

In case you would like to deploy a version which does not require Qt libraries in the client's system, consider statically build Qt then `qmake` with the `static` option, or change the config line in `PenguinSubtitlePlayer.pro` to
```
CONFIG += static \
          c++11
```

## Developing

Penguin Subtitle Player is a Qt5 project. The executables include statically compiled Qt libraries.
