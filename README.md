# Penguin Subtitle Player

Penguin Subtitle Player is an open-source, cross-platform standalone subtitle player, as an alternative to [Greenfish Subtitle Player](http://greenfish-subtitle-player.en.softonic.com/), [SrtViewer (Mac)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/srtviewer/), [SRTPlayer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleplayer/), [JustSubsPlayer](https://justsubsplayer.codeplex.com/) and [Free Subtitle Player](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesubtitleplayer/).

You download the .srt file from any sites you like and load it into the subtitle player. The subtitle player provides a translucent window which always stays on the top so that subtitles can be shown on top of the video without blocking anything.

With Penguin Subtitle Player, just open your favorite online streaming site, load the srt into the player, and enjoy.

* Linux: G++
* Mac OSX: G++

Check [here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html) for deployment details.

## Building

####The easy way

1. Download Qt with Qt Creator [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
2. Open the .pro file in Qt Creator
3. You should be good to go (In case of some weird compilation errors, turn off the shadow build option in projects build settings)

####The hard way

1. Download Qt (Qt Creator is not required) [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)
2. Run qmake
  ```
  qmake PenguinSubtitlePlayer.pro
  ```
3. Build from the makefile generated by qmake
  * G++ (Linux, Mac OSX): ```make```
  * VC++ (Windows): ```nmake```
  * MinGW (Windows): ```mingw32-make```
4. You should see the executable under ```build/debug``` or ```build/release```

In case you would like to deploy a version which does not require Qt libraries in the client's system, consider statically build Qt then qmake with the static option.
